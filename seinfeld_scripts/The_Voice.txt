Episode 158 (October 
              2, 1997)
(Scene: In the 
              Play Now office)
Thomassoulo: George, 
              youâ€™re not really handicapped, are you?
George: Iâ€™ve 
              had my difficulties.
Thomassoulo: I 
              saw you running down Amsterdam Avenue lifting that 200 pound motorized 
              cart with one hand.
George: Mr. Thomassoulo 
              during times of great stress, people are capable of super human 
              strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
Thomassoulo: No
George: How about 
              the old Spider Man live action show?
Thomassoulo: George, 
              Iâ€™ve realized weâ€™ve signed a one-year contract with you, 
              but at this point I think itâ€™s best that we both go our separate 
              ways.
George: I donâ€™t 
              understand.
Thomassoulo: We 
              donâ€™t like you. We want you to leave.
George: Clearer
(Scene: At Monks 
              Caf)
Jerry: So youâ€™re 
              staying at Play Now?
George: Why not? 
              Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped 
              toilets in the city.
Jerry: But they 
              not you arenâ€™t handicapped, arenâ€™t you ashamed?
George: Theyâ€™re 
              the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. 
              As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
(Elaine walks 
              in)
Elaine: Hey
Jerry & George: 
              (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
George: Hello-o-o-o 
              Elaine!
Elaine: Whatâ€™s 
              that?
Jerry: Oh, itâ€™s 
              just this stupid thing.
Elaine: Well, 
              Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s stupid. Itâ€™s not about me, is it?
Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) No-o-o-o.
George: (doing 
              the voice) Not at all.
Elaine: Tell me!
Jerry: All right. 
              You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
Elaine: Yeah.
Jerry: Well, he 
              and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays 
              awake all night and talks to me.
Elaine: How is 
              it talking?
Jerry: Well, her 
              belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Iâ€™m bored. 
              Talk to me.
Elaine: Oh I gotta 
              start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
(Puddy walks in)
Jerry: Hey, look 
              whose here - Puddy.
Elaine: My Puddy? 
              But we broke up.
Jerry: And yet 
              he continues to live.
(Puddy walks over 
              to the table)
Puddy: Hey Benes, 
              How are you?
Elaine: Iâ€™m 
              doing great.
Puddy: Great. 
              (pauses) See ya.
Jerry: Well, thatâ€™s 
              it. You two are back together.
Elaine: What?
Jerry: The bump 
              into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
Elaine: David 
              and I
will
not be getting back together.
Jerry: Elaine, 
              breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You canâ€™t 
              do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, 
              and then it goes over.
George: Thatâ€™s 
              beautiful.
Elaine: What about 
              you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
Jerry: Thatâ€™s 
              different. I didnâ€™t have feelings for those people. But you, 
              youâ€™ll backslide
Elaine: You want 
              to bet?
Jerry: Stakes?
Elaine: 50
Jerry: Dollars?
Elaine: All right. 
              Witness? (looks at George).
George: Witness.
Jerry: Done.
George: Percentage?
Jerry & Elaine: 
              No.
(Scene: At Jerryâ€™s 
              apartment)
Clare: So Iâ€™ll 
              call you tonight?
Jerry: Yeah.
Clare: Whatâ€™s 
              wrong with the belt?
Jerry: I went 
              to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled 
              a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of 
              the urinal. Soâ€¦(throws away belt) thatâ€™s it!
Clare: So, youâ€™re 
              insane?
Jerry: Oh yes, 
              quite.
(Kramer walks 
              in)
Kramer: Hello!
Jerry: Of course 
              itâ€™s a sliding scale.
Clare: Catch you 
              later.
Kramer & Jerry: 
              (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)
Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) La la la.
Kramer: (doing 
              the voice) La la la.
(Kramer is reading 
              the newspaper at the table)
Kramer: Look at 
              this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
Jerry: Oh, that 
              restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thatâ€™s a 
              good idea.
Kramer: Of course 
              itâ€™s a good idea, itâ€™s
my
idea. I conceived this 
              whole project two years ago.
Jerry: Which part? 
              The renovating the restaurant you donâ€™t own part or spending 
              the two hundred million you donâ€™t have part?
Kramer: You see 
              I come up with these things, I know theyâ€™re gold, but nothing 
              happens. You know why?
Jerry: No resources, 
              no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
Kramer: (interrupts) 
              No, noâ€¦time! Itâ€™s all this meaningless time. Laundry, 
              grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any 
              idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
Jerry: I can ball 
              park it.
(Elaine walks 
              in â€“ how did she come up without the buzzer?)
Elaine: (doing 
              the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
Kramer: Here we 
              go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
Jerry: Hey, I 
              called you last night, where were you?
Elaine: (looking 
              VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
Jerry: George?
Elaine: (looking 
              guiltier) No, noâ€¦no.
Jerry: Well, I 
              was here, thatâ€™s everyone (laughing).
Elaine: (laughing).
Jerry: Are those 
              the same shoes as yesterday?
Elaine: Oh, you 
              know I wear these shoes all the time.
Jerry: Your hair, 
              itâ€™s somewhat de-poofed.
Elaine: Itâ€™s 
              the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
Jerry: Wait a 
              second, whatâ€™s going on here?
Elaine: Nothing, 
              nothing.
Jerry: (screams).
Elaine: (screams).
Jerry: Youâ€™re 
              wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
Kramer: Hoochie 
              moochie. (haha)
Jerry: Hand it 
              over. Pay up.
Elaine: No! Itâ€™s 
              an isolated, sexual incident. We are
not
back together!
Jerry: Then what 
              do you call it? People donâ€™t just bump into each other and 
              have sex. This isnâ€™t cinemax.
Elaine: It was 
              no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed 
              a little dinner.
Jerry: Ah, dinner! 
              Thatâ€™s it, youâ€™re all the way back!
Elaine: Ugh!
Jerry: Sex, thatâ€™s 
              meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thatâ€™s heavy. 
              Thatâ€™s like an hour.
Kramer: (still 
              reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun 
              (Sp?). That was my idea too!
(Scene: At Play 
              Now)
George: Good Morning!
Co-worker: Go 
              to hell!
George: Hi Allison, 
              thatâ€™s a nice dress.
Allison: Donâ€™t 
              even look at me.
George: Hey Glenn!
Glenn: Hey, go 
              tell hell!
George: Heard 
              that one already.
(Scene: At Jerryâ€™s 
              apartment)
(Jerry walks in. 
              Kramer is showing his "intern," Darren around)
Kramer: â€¦So 
              thatâ€™s the bedroom. Hereâ€™s the bathroom. If you need to, 
              you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenâ€¦Yeah, go ahead 
              and look through some of the drawers.
Jerry: And you 
              are?
Darren: Oh, hey, 
              Iâ€™m Darren. Iâ€™m new here.
Kramer: Yeah, 
              thatâ€™s Jerry, you donâ€™t have to worry about him. Why donâ€™t 
              you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
Darren: Right!
Kramer: Heâ€™s 
              a go getter!
Jerry: Whoâ€™s 
              he?
Kramer: My intern 
              from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
Jerry: Alright.
Kramer: Well, 
              apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting 
              some real world corporate experience.
Jerry: But you 
              only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
Kramer: Well, 
              this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important 
              things, like my bladder system.
Jerry: Alright, 
              itâ€™s time to go.
Kramer: Jerry, 
              itâ€™s not for people, itâ€™s for oil tankers.
Jerry: (sarcastically) 
              I know!
(Jerry tries to 
              shove Kramer out the door)
Kramer: You see 
              the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, 
              the oil wonâ€™t spill out.
Jerry: Actually, 
              that is not a bad idea.
Kramer: (smiles) 
              yeah.
Jerry: Now, itâ€™s 
              time to go.
(slams door)
(phone rings)
Jerry: Hello
George: (doing 
              the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Heâ€™s sitting on the floor in his Play 
              Now office).
Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whatâ€™s going on?
George:   Siege mentality   Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyâ€™ve 
              downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Iâ€™m like Hitlerâ€™s 
           last days here.
Jerry: So, are 
              you going to leave?
George: Oh no! 
              Iâ€™m vigilant. Theyâ€™ll never get me out. Iâ€™m like 
              a weed, Jerry.
Jerry: I thought 
              youâ€™re like Hitler in the bunker?
George: Iâ€™m 
              a weed in Hitlerâ€™s bunker.
Jerry: Iâ€™m 
              getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other 
              line beeps) Iâ€™m getting another call, see yaâ€¦(answers 
              call) Hello!
Darren: Hi, this 
              is Darren from Kramerâ€™s office. Mr. Kramer would like to schedule 
              a lunch with you at Monkâ€™s coffee shop.
Jerry: (looking 
              shocked) Really? When?
Darren: In 10 
              minutes. Do you need directions?
Jerry: No, I donâ€™t.
Darren: Well, 
              Iâ€™ll call back in 5 minutes to confirm.
Kramer: Yeah, 
              5.
(Elaine walks 
              in â€“ again, how did she get up without the buzzer?)
Elaine: Hey!
Jerry: Hey! So, 
              whereâ€™s my money?
Elaine: No money, 
              I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
Jerry: Oh yeah, 
              hold on.
(Jerry calls Kramer 
              and Darren answers)
Jerry: Hello Darren, 
              this is Jerry from Jerryâ€™s office. (Elaine is looking confused). 
              Weâ€™re going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking 
              confused) What do you mean heâ€™s already left?
(Kramer walks 
              in)
Jerry: Hey, Elaine 
              is going to come with us, alright?
Kramer: What? 
              When did this happen?
Jerry: Well, justâ€¦
Kramer: (yelling) 
              DARREN!
(Scene: At Elaineâ€™s 
              apartment)
(Sitting on the 
              couch thinking to herself)
Elaine: I am
not
calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them 
              over at Puddyâ€™s. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, 
              I better not. Iâ€™ll call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! 
              There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. 
              Thatâ€™s funny. Thatâ€™s really funny. Thatâ€™s really 
              really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks 
              up phone).
(Scene: At Monkâ€™s 
              Cafe)
George: Well, 
              Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. 
              They tried to sweat me out.
Jerry: Do you 
              have to write
all
this stuff down.
Darren: Well, 
              Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didnâ€™t want 
              to miss anything.
Jerry: So, how 
              hot did it get?
George: I donâ€™t 
              know, 120, 130â€¦Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 
              hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
Jerry: I guess 
              you can take anything, but actual work.
George: Bring 
              it on!
(Kramer walks 
              in)
George: (doing
the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!
Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!
George: (doing 
              the voice) La la la.
Kramer: Sorry 
              I couldnâ€™t get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
Darren: Well, 
              after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether 
              or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and 
              his iron suitâ€¦
Kramer: Uh huhâ€¦
George: (Interrupts) 
              And I still say heâ€™s naked under there!
Jerry: Oh that 
              makes a lot of sense.
George: Oh, shut 
              up!
Darren: â€¦Then 
              Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped 
              ice out of Mr. Seinfeldâ€™s drink with his bare hands using it 
              to wash up (Jerry is taking a sip of water and looking mad) then 
              Mr. Costanza remarked to me, "This never happened." (Jerry 
              then spits out the water).
(George is looking 
              pissed off)
(Scene: At Jerryâ€™s 
              apartment in his bed)
Jerry: (giggling)
Clare: Whatâ€™s 
              so funny?
Jerry: Oh, nothing. 
              (still giggling)
Clare: What are 
              you laughing about? Tell me.
Jerry: Oh all 
              right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weâ€™ve been doing 
              this silly, dumb voice.
(Clare storms 
              out of the room mad!)
Clare: So is it 
              fun humiliating me?
Jerry: No, itâ€™s 
              not you. Itâ€™s your stomach, heâ€™s taking with this funny, 
              booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Clare: So you 
              think Iâ€™m fat?
Jerry: No itâ€™sâ€¦
(Darren walks 
              in)
Darren: Mr. Kramer 
              says, "hey buddy!"
Jerry: Hey, weâ€™re 
              kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back 
              later?
Darren: Oh yeah 
              sure, sure. Should we set something up now?
Jerry: (Screams) 
              GET OUT!
Clare: Iâ€™m 
              leaving too.
Jerry: No body 
              said youâ€™re fat. Heâ€™s a loving character, like the Kool-ade 
              guy.
Clare:
He
is fat!
Jerry: No, heâ€™s 
              just a little bloated.
Clare: Good-bye!
Jerry: Itâ€™s 
              mostly water weight.
(Kramer walks 
              in)
Kramer: Boysenberry, 
              the kid is still learning.
(Darren is standing 
              in the hallway on the phone)
Darren: Mr. Kramerâ€¦Dean, 
              my internship is on line two, she wants to set up a meeting.
Kramer: Yeah, 
              well nothing before noon.
Jerry: Line two?
Kramer: Yeah, 
              your phone is line one.
Jerry: Ohâ€¦
(Scene: At Elaineâ€™s 
              apartment)
Puddy: So the 
              gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny.
Elaine: See, this 
              is what Jerryâ€™s doesnâ€™t understand. We can see each other. 
              We can see each other every day, but it doesnâ€™t mean we are 
              back together.
Puddy: I mean 
              I love just seeing you and having sex.
Elaine: Yeah.
Puddy: Not having 
              to do all thatâ€¦you knowâ€¦work.
Elaine: Well, 
              either wayâ€¦
Puddy: All that 
              calling you, and buying you stuffâ€¦
Elaine: Davidâ€¦
Puddy: Caring 
              about how everyone at work isnâ€™t as smart as you. Itâ€™s 
              brutal.
Elaine: Alright 
              thatâ€™s it! Weâ€™re back together!
Puddy: Oh, no.
Elaine: Oh, yeah.
Puddy: Look Elaine, 
              be reasonable.
(Elaine kisses 
              Puddy)
Elaine: Get those 
              clothes off. Youâ€™re going to spend the night and weâ€™re 
              going to cuddle.
Puddy: What?
Elaine: You heard 
              me. Strip!
(Scene: At Play 
              Now)
(George is walking 
              in the hallway to his office. He sees his office has been boarded 
              up)
George: (whistling)â€¦.(laughing)â€¦.Alrightâ€¦â€¦OKâ€¦.
(George goes through 
              air vent â€“ in his office)
George: (on phone 
              â€“ calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are 
              you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message 
              for me? â€¦Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) Iâ€™M IN 
              MY OFFICE! Thanks.
(Scene: At NYU)
Kramer: Dean Jones, 
              you wanting to talk to me?
Dean Jones: Iâ€™ve 
              been reviewing Darrenâ€™s internship journal. Doing laundryâ€¦
Kramer: â€¦Yeah.
Dean Jones: â€¦Mending 
              chicken wire, hi-tea with a Mr. Newman.
Kramer: I know 
              it sounds pretty glamorous, but itâ€™s business as usual at Kramerica.
Dean Jones: As 
              far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary 
              man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken.
Kramer: And with 
              Darrenâ€™s help, weâ€™ll get that chicken.
Dean Jones: Iâ€™m 
              sorry, but we canâ€™t allow Darren to continue working with you.
Kramer: Well, 
              I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
Dean Jones: You 
              fly is open.
(Scene: At Jerryâ€™s 
              apartment)
(Jerry & Clare 
              are talking by the doorway)
Jerry: So youâ€™re 
              sure youâ€™re not still angry about last night?
Clare: No, Iâ€™m 
              fine. Just as long as you donâ€™t ever do that voice again.
Jerry: Never?
Clare: Never.
Jerry: What about 
              if youâ€™re not around?
Clare: No!
Jerry: So I have 
              to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
Clare: Thatâ€™s 
              right.
Jerry: I can do 
              that.
Clare: So whatâ€™s 
              your decision?
Jerry: I donâ€™t 
              know.
(At the dock or 
              beach)
(Jerry is thinking 
              to himself â€“ looking quite funny)
(Heâ€™s thinking 
              about all the times him and Clare spent together. Heâ€™s trying 
              to decide if he likes her more or the voice more)
(Jerry knocks 
              on Clareâ€™s door)
Clare: Jerryâ€¦HI.
Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)
(Scene: At Jerryâ€™s 
              apartment)
George: You broke 
              up with her? Why?
Jerry: So we could 
              do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whatâ€™s the matter?
George: I think 
              Iâ€™m getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? 
              La-la-la?
Jerry: No, it
can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
George: I think 
              I like the girl better than the voice.
Jerry: Really?
(Elaine walks 
              in â€“ how does she keep getting up without that buzzer?!)
Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
Elaine: Still?
George: I told 
              you.
Elaine: Alright, 
              here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
Jerry: See, never 
              bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
Elaine: Yeah, 
              well not for long. Iâ€™m breaking up with him.
Jerry: No, I donâ€™t 
              think so. Iâ€™ve seen you two together. You make each other miserable. 
              Itâ€™s kismet.
Elaine: Double 
              or nothing.
Jerry: Done.
George: (talking 
              from bathroom) Witness?
Jerry: Youâ€™re 
              in there again.
George: I think 
              Play Now is putting something in my food.
(Kramer walks 
              in)
Elaine: Alright, 
              Iâ€™m out of here.
Jerry: What is 
              this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnâ€™t fit 
              him).
Kramer: I donâ€™t 
              know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havenâ€™t 
              been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. 
              Iâ€™m clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
Jerry: Yeah. Nine 
              oâ€™clock.
Kramer: I was 
              supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
Jerry: (doing 
              the voice) Good-bye Kramer.
Kramer: Jerry, 
              buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
Jerry: Really?
Kramer: So played.
George: I told 
              you.
(Scene: Hallway, 
              Darren is knocking on Kramerâ€™s door)
Kramer: Darren? 
              What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
Darren: I donâ€™t 
              care about the internship. I care about Kramerica.
Kramer: Kramerica 
              is no more.
Darren: What about 
              the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime 
              oil spills.
Kramer: Probably. 
              Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
(Kramer slams 
              door)
(Kramer opens 
              door)
Kramer: Well, 
              youâ€™re still here?
Darren: I havenâ€™t 
              had time to leave.
Kramer: Well, 
              I havenâ€™t changed my mind.
(Kramer slams 
              door)
(Kramer opens 
              door)
Kramer: Well, 
              you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Iâ€™ll do it. Kramerica 
              industries lives! Letâ€™s get back to work!
(Kramer slams 
              door)
(Kramer opens 
              door)
Kramer: Letâ€™s 
              see what Jerry has to eat.
(Scene: At Play 
              Now â€“ in the bosses office)
Thomassoulo: You 
              win George. Weâ€™ve had it. If you leave right now, Play Now 
              will give you six months pay. Thatâ€™s half of your entire contract. 
              Pleaseâ€¦just go.
George: You see 
              if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
Thomassoulo: Want 
              to play hand ball huh? Fine. (calls on intercom) Attention Play 
              Now employees, George Costanzaâ€™s handicapped bathroom is now 
              open on the sixteenth floor to all employees and their families.
George: Well played.
Thomassoulo: Iâ€™ll 
              see you in hell Costanza.
(Scene: At Jerryâ€™s 
              apartment)
Jerry: (on the 
              phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our 
              relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. 
              Hold on one second. (George walks in â€“ Jerry asks George) So 
              we definitely donâ€™t want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes 
              his head NO) Alright, weâ€™re back together again, great. Bye 
              bye.
(Scene: Hallway 
              â€“ Kramer & Darren are pushing an oil tank.
Kramer: Hey.
Jerry: Trouble 
              down at the plant?
Kramer: Itâ€™s 
              a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder 
              system.
George: You have 
              to drink that whole thing?
Kramer: No. No. 
              No. Itâ€™s for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort 
              of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or 
              not it can restrain the impact.
Jerry: I understand 
              (not really understanding, lol).
George: Would 
              a giant rubber ball work?
Kramer: Conceivably.
George: Well, 
              Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why donâ€™t 
              we test your bladder system at my office?
Jerry: Youâ€™re 
              notâ€¦
George: Oh, yes 
              I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, thereâ€™s nothing 
              dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
(Scene: At Monkâ€™s 
              Cafe)
Puddy: Hey, you 
              want to split a root beer (I think thatâ€™s what he says)?
Elaine: I donâ€™t 
              think so David, weâ€™re through.
Puddy: Ohâ€¦Thatâ€™s 
              a nice sweater (Elaine smiles).
(Scene: At Elaineâ€™s 
              house â€“ the two are in bed)
Elaine: Whew that 
              was a dozy.
(Scene: At Jerryâ€™s 
              apartment)
(Elaine throws 
              down money on the table).
Jerry: Go again?
Elaine: Book it.
George: (again 
              from bathroom) Witness.
(Scene: At Elaineâ€™s 
              apartment)
Elaine: David 
              I know this hurts, but itâ€™s the way it has to be (Puddy is 
              giving her a look like heâ€™s going to still get some).
(Scene: At Jerryâ€™s 
              apartment)
(Elaine is placing 
              money on the table one by one)
Jerry: Ha ha ha. 
              Ha ha ha ha.
(Scene: Jerry 
              and Elaine at the movies)
Elaine: Iâ€™m 
              going to get some popcorn.
(Scene: At Jerryâ€™s 
              apartment)
(Elaine hands 
              Jerry money)
Elaine: So, how 
              did it end?
Jerry: They got 
              away.
Elaine: uh.
(Scene: At Elaineâ€™s 
              apartment)
Elaine: Listen 
              David, Iâ€™ve got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
(Scene: At Play 
              Now)
(Darren & 
              Kramer are pushing the ball of oil â€“ Jerry walks in)
Jerry: Hey.
Kramer: Did you 
              bring the video camera?
Jerry: Yeah, I 
              put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, 
              and most of your trial. Alright, Iâ€™ll see ya.
George: Oh, you 
              might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong 
              man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
Jerry: I canâ€™t. 
              I got to meet Clare.
Kramer: You gave 
              up the voice?
Jerry: Yeah, I 
              thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
Kramer & George: 
              No. No
Jerry: Darren?
Darren: Sorry 
              Mr. Seinfeld.
Jerry: Uh, bathroom.
George: Hey, use 
              mine. Iâ€™ll let you in.
Jerry: I thought 
              it was open to the public.
George: I uh, 
              took care of that.
(Both go to the 
              bathroom, which looks really nice)
Jerry: Wow! Zanadu 
              . No wonder youâ€™re putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) 
              May I?
George: I insist. 
              Iâ€™ll fix us a drink. (phone rings â€“ who would that be?) 
              I got it.
(Back to Kramer 
              & Darren in Georgeâ€™s office)
Kramer: Whew. 
              You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago 
              that some day Iâ€™d be standing here about to solve the worlds 
              energy problems, I wouldâ€™ve said youâ€™re crazyâ€¦ Now 
              letâ€™s push this giant ball of oil out the window.
(Back in the bathroom)
George: So, check 
              out my view.
Jerry: Wow! Hey, 
              thereâ€™s Clare. I better go down.
George: Hey, thereâ€™s 
              Kramer & Darren.
Jerry: Thereâ€™s 
              the giant ball of oil. Clareâ€™s right underneath that thing. 
              Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
Clare: I donâ€™t 
              believe this. I am
not
looking up if youâ€™re going to 
              do that voice.
Kramer: Bombs 
              away (Uh oh).
Jerry: This is 
              going to be a shame.
(SPLAT!)
George: Hello.
Kramer: Well, 
              that didnâ€™t work. Hey, how about thisâ€¦ketchup and mustard 
              in the same bottle?
Darren: Oh that 
              sounds interesting sir.
Kramer: Yeah.
(Police sirens 
              â€“ uh oh)
(Scene: At Monkâ€™s 
              Caf)
Jerry: Clare won 
              her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. 
              I guess youâ€™re not going in anymore.
George: Yeah.
Jerry: So theyâ€™re 
              not paying you yourâ€¦
George: No.
Jerry: So youâ€™re 
              pretty muchâ€¦
George: Yeah.
Jerry: What ever 
              happened to Darren?
Kramer: Darren 
              is going away for a long long time.
Jerry: So Clare 
              sure looked real funny covered in oil like thatâ€¦ (doing the 
              voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oilâ€¦
George: (doing 
              the voice) Iâ€™m slippery as an eelâ€¦
Kramer: (doing 
              the voice) La la la.
Jerry: Iâ€™m 
              just so glad itâ€™s back.
(Scene: At Elaineâ€™s 
              apartment in bed with Puddy AGAIN)
Elaine: See, this 
              is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling 
              ourselves. We belong together.
Puddy: Elaine: 
              I want to break up.
Elaine: Ah nuts!
