----------------------------------------------------------------------
At the Comedy Club.
Jerry: You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. 
              But
itâ€™s really like one of the only jobs where you have to have 
              your diploma
right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnâ€™t 
              it? "I
really am a doctor you know. You think Iâ€™m not, just check 
              it out." I donâ€™t
know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage 
              over us all the
time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 
              minutes, and Iâ€™ll
give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with 
              pants on seems
like they know what theyâ€™re talking about. In any difference 
              of opinion,
pants always beats no-pants.
(Commercial)
At a restaurant.
George: Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is
unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
Georgeâ€™s girlfriend (name?): Twenty five dollars.
George: Yes, well, you know, Iâ€™m not thinking about the price. 
              You know
youâ€™re the only woman Iâ€™ve never thought about the price. 
              Get the lobster. I
beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
Georgeâ€™s girlfriend: George, George, uh, I think we have to 
              talk. I think we
have a problem.
George: We do?
Georgeâ€™s girlfriend: We canâ€™t keep seeing each other.
George: Why?
Georgeâ€™s girlfriend: (crying) Because itâ€™s over. *sob, 
              sob, sob* Itâ€™s my
parents, the differences in our religion. Oh George, can you ever 
              forgive me?
*sob*
Waiter: Uh, have you decided yet?
Georgeâ€™s girlfriend: (crying) Yes. Iâ€™ll have the lobster.
George: Um, you know Iâ€™m starting to think that maybe lobster 
              isnâ€™t the way
to go.
The hallway outside Jerryâ€™s apartment.
Jerry: Then he asked you out?
Elaine: We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then 
              he put his
hand on my heart.
Jerry: On your heart?
Elaine: Jerry, the man is a doctor.
Jerry: Doctor? Heâ€™s a podiatrist.
Elaine: Itâ€™s the same thing.
Jerry: Anyone can get into podiatry school. *George* got into podiatry
school.
Elaine: Really?
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend (name?): Hello.
Jerry: Oh hi.
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: Are you going to be stopping by later?
Jerry: Yes, Iâ€™ll be stopping. See you later. (to Elaine) Well 
              we canâ€™t all
be dating podiatrists.
They enter Jerryâ€™s apartment.
George: Itâ€™s over.
Elaine: What?
Jerry: How did you get in?
George: Kramer.
Elaine: Whatâ€™s that?
George: Lobster.
Jerry: Looks like a swan.
George: She says we canâ€™t go out anymore.
Elaine: Why?
George: Because Iâ€™m not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wonâ€™t 
              let her get
involved with anyone who isnâ€™t Latvian Orthodox.
Elaine: Latvian Orthodox? Mmm, it is lobster.
Jerry: Sheâ€™s limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
George: I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thatâ€™s 
              not
entirely true.
Elaine: Mmm, delicious.
Jerry: Mmm, succulent.
George: She knew I didnâ€™t have a job, she knew I lived at 
              home. Didnâ€™t seem
to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
Elaine: Why donâ€™t you just ask her parents?
George: I canâ€™t. I met them. Theyâ€™re devout. You know, 
              In the cab on the
way over here, I actually thought about converting.
Jerry: To Latvian Orthodox?
George: Why not? What do I care?
Jerry: You know itâ€™s not like changing toothpaste.
Elaine: I think it would be romantic.
George: Really?
Elaine: Yeah, itâ€™s like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne 
              and marrying
Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
George: King Edward. King Edward, Jerry.
Jerry: Yeah well King Edward didnâ€™t live in Queens with Frank 
              and Estelle
Costanza.
George: You know what? I could probably do this. Whatâ€™s the 
              difference.
Elaine: George I was just kidding around.
George: No. I wouldnâ€™t even have to tell her. I could surprise 
              her.
Elaine: George I wasnâ€™t serious.
George: How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, have 
              a
ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am *really* going to 
              think about
this.
George leaves.
Elaine: I guess this one is my fault.
Jerry: Oh yeah.
At Jerryâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s apartment.
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: *kiss, kiss, kiss* Oh that was nice. Have 
              you always
been such a good kisser?
Jerry: Oh I donâ€™t know. Not always. No I uh I had to work 
              at it. When I
was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my 
              room
practicing my kissing.
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: Well it was worth it. *kiss* Iâ€™ll 
              be *kiss* right *kiss*
back *kiss*. Where are you going?
Jerry: To wash my hands. Theyâ€™re sticky from the orange.
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: Meet you back here?
Jerry: Right there.
Jerry goes into the bathroom and washes his hands.
He sees the medicine cabinet open slightly and peeks in.
Jerry: (thinking to himself) "Fungicide". Fungus?
At Monkâ€™s.
Jerry: Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
Elaine: I donâ€™t know.
Kramer: Fungus.
Elaine: So what did you say?
Jerry: I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I 
              had to go
home.
Elaine: What were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
Jerry: I didnâ€™t open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
Elaine: You were snooping.
Jerry: I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was 
              no breaking
and entering. I wouldnâ€™t do that.
Kramer: I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
Elaine: Well I trust people not to do that.
Kramer: Big mistake.
Jerry: Why donâ€™t you ask that doctor what it is?
Elaine: What? Now heâ€™s a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
Jerry: But thatâ€™s what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. 
              Theyâ€™re knee-
deep in fungus. This guy know fungus.
Elaine: I am not going to ask him about funguses.
Kramer: Fungi.
Jerry: What?
Kramer: Fungi.
In the priestâ€™s office.
[boy, I am *really* bad with names on this episodeâ€¦ ;) ]
Father-priest (name?): Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox 
              faith?
George: *ahem* In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man 
              begins to ask
himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words 
              something
so umâ€¦ (trying to think of a word)
Father-priest: Enigmatic?
George: No.
Father-priest: Vast? (he pronounces it as "vost")
George: No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
Father-priest: Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion.
George: Yes.
Father-priest 2: Is there one aspect of the faith that you find 
              particularly
attractive?
George: (he thinks) I think the hats. The hat convey that solemn 
              religious
look you want in a faith. Very pious.
Father-priest: Are you familiar with Orthodox theology?
George: Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know 
              the basic
plot. Yeah.
Father-priest: Plot?
George: Yeah, yeah. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and 
              the
commandments and all that.
Father-priest 2: Well itâ€™s obvious that you are sincere in 
              your desire.
George: Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, 
              am I in?
Father-priest: The first step would be to familiarize yourself 
              with these
texts (brings out a pile of books).
George: Ah hah. You see Father, Iâ€™m Iâ€™m incredibly anxious 
              to become a
member. Um, donâ€™t you offer any kind of an express conversion? 
              A quick
change?
Sister Roberta enters.
Sister Roberta: Oh Iâ€™m sorry. Father, thereâ€™s a man waiting 
              in the chapel.
Father-priest: You may attend to it Sister, oh this is George Costanza. 
              He
is interested in joining the church.
Sister Roberta: Oh are you? Thatâ€™s wonderful. Well good luck 
              to you.
George: Nice nun.
Father-priest: No, Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we 
              call a
novice.
Father-priest 2: She wonâ€™t be taking her final vows until 
              next Thursday.
In the chapel.
Sister Roberta: May I help you?
Kramer: Oh yeah, Iâ€™m here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
Sister Roberta: Well heâ€™s in with the Father.
Kramer: Oh yeah.
Sister Roberta: Iâ€™m Sister Roberta.
Kramer: Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.
Sister Roberta: Mine. (she smiles at Kramer)
At Jerryâ€™s apartment.
George: I canâ€™t believe how easy it is. Iâ€™m virtually 
              Orthodox. All I have
to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Iâ€™m 
              in the club.
Jerry: Thatâ€™s all there is to it.
George: Thatâ€™s all there is to it. By Christmas day I will 
              be Brother
Costanza.
Jerry: And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother 
              Costanza?
George: Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
Kramer enters. He is flinging a slinky.
Jerry: Oh a slinky. Where did you get it?
Kramer: Sister Roberta gave it to me.
Jerry: Why did she give you that?
Kramer: I think she liked me.
Jerry: What do you mean she liked you?
Kramer: *Liked* me.
George: Kramer, they like everybody. Theyâ€™re friendly people.
Kramer: No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
Jerry: You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
Kramer: Yeah, Jerry Iâ€™m telling you I have this power. And 
              I have no control
over it.
Kramer leaves.
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend appears at the doorway.
Jerry: Oh hi.
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: I just wanted to stop by and see how you 
              were feeling.
Jerry: (weakly) A little better. *fake cough*
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: If you need anything let me know.
Jerry: Okay. All right bye.
George: Story.
Jerry: Sheâ€™s subletting Carolâ€™s place for a month.
George: She likes you.
Jerry: Yeah but thereâ€™s a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide 
              in her
medicine cabinet.
George: So?
Jerry: So I donâ€™t know what sheâ€™s using it for.
George: Well how do you even know itâ€™s hers? Maybe it belonged 
              to Carol.
Did you see a name on the tube?
Jerry: I didnâ€™t even think to look.
George: Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
Jerry: Yeah.
George: People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
Jerry: Yeah Iâ€™ve got this old bottle of cough medicine.
George: I still have brill cream.
At Jerryâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s apartment.
Jerry knocks on the door
*knock, knock, knock*
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: Hi.
Jerry: Hi. Can I use your bathroom?
At the doctorâ€™s apartment.
Elaine: You sure you donâ€™t mind?
Doctor (name?): No of course not. People ask me medical questions 
              all the
time.
Elaine: Well the question isnâ€™t even for me itâ€™s for 
              a friend.
Doctor: Elaine, Iâ€™m used to it. Iâ€™m a doctor.
Elaine: Wellâ€¦ podiatrist.
Doctor: Huh?
Elaine: No no, Iâ€™m just saying you didnâ€™t really go to 
              medical school, you
went to podiatry school. Which Iâ€™m sure is very grueling in 
              itâ€™s own way.
Doctor: I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose 
              to work with
feet.
Elaine: I like feet too. Iâ€™m just sayingâ€¦
Doctor: Saying what?
In Jerryâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s apartment.
She knocks on the bathroom door.
*knock, knock, knock*
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: How are you doing in there?
Jerry: Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
Jerry is looking around for the bottle of fungicide.
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: No soap?
Jerry: No I donâ€™t see it.
Jerry finds the bottle of fungicide and picks it up. Jerryâ€™s 
              girlfriend
enters the bathroom with soap. Hastily, Jerry puts the bottle of 
              fungicide in
his pocket.
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: (giving Jerry the soap) Here you go.
At Georgeâ€™s parentâ€™s house.
George is in the bathroom with his Latvian Orthodox books.
*knock, knock, knock*
Estelle: George what are you doing in there?
George: What? Nothing.
Frank: Youâ€™ve been in there an hour.
Estelle: You donâ€™t feel well?
George: Iâ€™m fine.
Estelle: I want to know what youâ€™re doing in there.
George: Nothing.
Frank: George, open the door.
George: No.
Estelle: Georgie.
George: No!
At Kramerâ€™s apartment.
Sister Roberta is knocking on the door.
*knock, knock, knock*
Kramer: Hey.
Sister Roberta: Good evening. I hope Iâ€™m not disturbing you, 
              but I found
another toy I thought you might like.
(Commercial)
At Jerryâ€™s Apartment.
Jerry: Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Iâ€™ll 
              need that in the
form of a question.
George: I donâ€™t know. I canâ€™t believe theyâ€™re making 
              me take this test.
Elaine enters.
Jerry: Hey, did you talk to the doctor?
Elaine: No.
Jerry: All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He 
              presents the
bottle of fungicide.)
Elaine: You *took* her medicine.
Jerry: Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the 
              tube. When
are you seeing him again?
Elaine: I donâ€™t know. We got into this whole thing about how 
              podiatrists
arenâ€™t real doctors.
Jerry: How could you say that?
Elaine: Itâ€™s you fault. You just got me thinking.
Jerry: I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
Elaine: Iâ€™ve got nothing against the foot. Iâ€™m pro-foot.
Jerry: Me too.
Elaine: Do you think I should call him and apologize?
Jerry: Yes. Heâ€™s a doctor.
Elaine starts to leave.
Jerry: Wait a second.
Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaineâ€™s purse.
Jerry: (to George) What are you doing?
George: What does it look like Iâ€™m doing?
Jerry: (Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, 
              Luke, Paul", what
youâ€™re cheating on your conversion chest?
Kramer enters.
Kramer: I told you.
Jerry: What?
Kramer: I told you she liked me.
Jerry: Who?
Kramer: Sister Roberta.
Jerry: How do you know?
Kramer: She told me. She said sheâ€™s never had a man stir up 
              all of these
feelings inside of her. Sheâ€™s questioning her faith. Sheâ€™s 
              thinking of
leaving the church. Oh, uh, this power. Iâ€™m dangerous Jerry, 
              Iâ€™m very very
dangerous.
At the priestâ€™s office.
Father-priest: I must say George, I was somewhat surprised at the 
              results of
your conversion test. I donâ€™t recall having seen such an impressive
performance. You truly must be filled with the spirit of the Lord.
George: Oh, Iâ€™m Iâ€™m full of it Father.
Father-priest 2: (muttering something to Father-Priest 1) â€¦(mumble)â€¦ 
              Kramer
â€¦(mumble)â€¦
Father-priest: Yes, yes I see. (To George) Iâ€™m sorry something 
              has come up.
George: Oh, I understand.
Kramer enters.
Kramer: Um, you wanted to see me Father?
Father-priest: Yes. Please, sit down. Sister Roberta came to see 
              me
yesterday.
Kramer: I know what this is about Father. I didnâ€™t do anything. 
              I just
spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Itâ€™s just 
              that, that I have
this power.
Father-priest: Yes. Kavorka.
[I wouldnâ€™t mind having "Kavorka" myself ;) ]
Kramer: Kavorka?
Father-priest: It is a Latvian word which means "the lure 
              of the animal".
Kramer: I donâ€™t understand.
Father-priest: Women are drawn to you. They would give anything 
              to be
possessed by you.
Kramer: Help me Father. Help me.
Father-priest: Yes, yes I will help you. Listen very carefully. 
              I want you
to buy ten cloves of garlic, three quarts of vinegar, six ouncesâ€¦
The hallway by Jerryâ€™s apartment.
Jerry: What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to 
              Kramerâ€™s
door) Ah hah.
*knock, knock, knock*
Kramer opens his door. He is wearing a ring of garlics around his 
              neck.
Kramer: Hey.
Jerry: Hey. What are you doing?
Kramer: Iâ€™ve got the Kavorka Jerry.
Jerry: The Kavorka? Whatâ€™s that?
Kramer: The lure of the animal. Iâ€™m dangerous.
Jerry: What is this thing around your neck?
Kramer: The priests theyâ€™re helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
Jerry: You know youâ€™re funcifying the whole building.
Kramer: Keep away Jerry. Keep away.
He closes his door.
Jerry: Kramer. *knock, knock, knock* Kramer.
At the entrance of the church. There is a sign there. It reads:
+---------------------+
| CONVERSION CEREMONY |
| FOR |
| GEORGE COSTANZA |
| 3:P.M. |
| |
| |
| |
+---------------------+
The sign is on a black background with white stick-on letters.
A woman reads the sign.
Woman: George Costanza? Estelleâ€™s son?
At Georgeâ€™s parentâ€™s house.
Estelle: Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
George: For a woman.
Frank: A woman? What are you out of your mind?
Estelle: Why canâ€™t you do anything like a normal person?
Frank: Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
George: No itâ€™s a regular religion.
Frank: Iâ€™m calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to 
              get out of this.
George: I donâ€™t want to get out of it.
Estelle: George, you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re saying. Youâ€™re 
              under their
control.
Frank: What, they brainwashed you?
George: No no.
Frank: Youâ€™re not performing any rituals in this house.
Estelle: Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
Frank: And stay away from those squirrels.
At Jerryâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s apartment.
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: Oh how you doing Jerry?
Jerry: Good. Whatâ€™s the matter?
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: Iâ€™m tired. I hardly slept last night 
              with all this
scratching. Bonkers was going crazy.
Jerry: Bonkers?
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: My cat. Heâ€™s got this weird sort 
              of skin condition.
Some type of fungus, I couldnâ€™t find his medicine.
Jerry: Oh itâ€™s your cat!
Jerryâ€™s girlfriend: What?
Jerry: Ooh, nothing.
At the church.
Father-priest: Are you ready my son?
George: Yes faddah.
Father-priest: What did you say?
George: What?
Father-priest: I thought you said faddah.
George: I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
Outside on a sidewalk.
A woman is waiting for a cab. Kramer walks up to her.
Kramer: How you doing?
Woman: Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)
Kramer: Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Iâ€™ve still got 
              time to catch
her.
At the church. It is Georgeâ€™s conversion ceremony.
Church music plays.
George is dressed in a white church gown.
He walks down the church aisle carrying a candle.
Father-priest says some Latvian words.
Kramer is running down the street going to the church.
The church music is still playing.
George takes a drink of some wine. He spills some on his gown. 
              He makes a
hand motion on his gown.
Kramer is still running to the church.
The church music is still playing.
Father-priest: Congratulations George. Welcome to the faith. Sister 
              Roberta
would you please offer the final benediction.
Sister Roberta: (hesitates) I canâ€™t. (crowd murmurs) Iâ€™m 
              sorry. Itâ€™s a
beautiful religion, but I am not worthy of it. I found something 
              else.
Kramer enters the church.
Sister Roberta: Him.
Crowd: Kavorka, Kavorka.
At Elaineâ€™s apartment.
Elaine: *kiss, kiss* Because I love the foot. Iâ€™m a big fan 
              of the foot.
Doctor: Well itâ€™s my fault. I got a little defensive.
Elaine: And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie 
              toe.
Doctor: Itâ€™s my favorite toe.
Elaine: Letâ€™s face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? 
              Youâ€™re not
going to the ear guy.
Doctor: No youâ€™re not.
*phone rings*
Elaine: Iâ€™ll be right back.
Doctor: Oh uh, whereâ€™s the bathroom?
Elaine: Itâ€™s right down here to the left. I will meet you 
              right back here.
Jerry: Elaine itâ€™s her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need 
              the tube
back.
The doctor is in Elaineâ€™s bathroom.
He peeks into the medicine cabinet and finds the tube of fungicide.
Doctor: (Thinking to himself) "Fungicide"? Fungus?
At the church.
Sister Roberta: Somethingâ€™s wrong. I donâ€™t feel the same 
              lure.
Kramer: You donâ€™t?
Sister Roberta: What have Iâ€¦? I must return to the church.

At Monkâ€™s
Georgeâ€™s girlfriend: For me?
George: Well I didnâ€™t do it for my mother.
Georgeâ€™s girlfriend: Iâ€™m really flattered. But I just 
              donâ€™t feel ready to
make a commitment yet. Maybe when I get back from Latvia.
George: Latvia?
Georgeâ€™s girlfriend: Yes. Iâ€™m going to stay with some 
              relatives there for a
year. Isnâ€™t it great?
George: Enjoy, enjoy.
Georgeâ€™s girlfriend: Oh George, you are so sweet. Donâ€™t 
              ever change.
George: Iâ€™d like a doggie bag for this please.
The End.
