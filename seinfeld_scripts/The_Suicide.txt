Monologue
The thing I donâ€™t understand about the suicide person is the people 
        who try and commit suicide for some reason they donâ€™t die and thatâ€™s 
        it. They stop trying. Why? Why donâ€™t they just keep trying? What 
        has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact itâ€™s worse 
        because now theyâ€™ve found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, 
        thatâ€™s why these people donâ€™t succeed in life to begin with. 
        Because they give up too easy. I saw, pills donâ€™t work, try a rope. 
        Car wonâ€™t start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? 
        Thereâ€™s nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set 
        for yourself.
[Jerryâ€™s Apartment]
JERRY: Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you 
        think that would have a negative effect on his life?
ELAINE: Na.
JERRY: What are you doing? Weâ€™re going out for dinner in ten minutes.
ELAINE: Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three 
        days?
[buzzer]
JERRY: Yeah.
GEORGE: Itâ€™s George.
JERRY: Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youâ€™ve got to fast 
        for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
ELAINE: I donâ€™t know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could 
        have given me ulcers?
JERRY: I think Iâ€™ll take out the garbage.
ELAINE: Hey, have you ever fasted?
JERRY: Well, once I didnâ€™t have dinner until, like 9:00 oâ€™clock, 
        that was pretty rough. [exits to hall with garbage â€“ meets George] 
        Hey, do me a favour will yaâ€™? Throw out my garbage for me.
GEORGE: Yeah, right.
JERRY: Come on, itâ€™s just down the hall.
GEORGE: Give me two bucks. Iâ€™ll do it for two bucks.
JERRY: Iâ€™ll give you 50 cents.
GEORGE: Thereâ€™s no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
JERRY: Come on. Fifty cents. <??> a piece of Drakeâ€™s coffee 
        cake
GEORGE: Youâ€™re not getting no Drakeâ€™s Coffee Cake for fifty 
        cents. Yae, Hey, Iâ€™m all set. I got the ticket. Iâ€™m going to 
        the Cayman Islands this Friday.
JERRY: I donâ€™t get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What 
        do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
GEORGE: Itâ€™s an incredible deal. I donâ€™t know why you donâ€™t 
        come with me.
JERRY: Nah, I donâ€™t go for these non-refundable deals. I canâ€™t 
        commit to a woman. Iâ€™m not going to commit to an airline.
[Gina enters the hall]
GINA: Hi.
JERRY: Hi.
GINA: How are you?
JERRY: Gina, do you know what a Drakeâ€™s Coffee Cake is?
GINA: Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.
JERRY: How much do they cost?
GINA: The junior?
GEORGE: No, no the full size.
JERRY: No, no the junior.
GEORGE: You didnâ€™t say "junior".
GINA: I havenâ€™t had one of those since I was a little girl.
JERRY: Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! 
        [MARTIN enters the hall] How yaâ€™ doing?
MARTIN: Good enough.
[MARTIN leaves with Gina]
JERRY: Boy sheâ€™s sexy isnâ€™t she?
[Jerry leaves garbage bag by Kramerâ€™s apartment and knocks on the 
        door. As he and George enter Jerryâ€™s apartment Kramer comes out and 
        takes the garbage bag.]
JERRY: Do you believe that guy?
ELAINE: What guy?
JERRY: My neighbour:
ELAINE: Oh, that creepy guy?
JERRY: Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
GEORGE: He didnâ€™t seem too pleased.
ELAINE: Maybe Iâ€™ll get a steak with french fried onion wings.
GEORGE: hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream 
        about that guy last night. This is amazing.
JERRY: Whatâ€™s so amazing? Youâ€™ve seen him before.
GEORGE: I havenâ€™t seen him for months.
JERRY: What was the dream?
GEORGE: I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night 
        club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics 
        off.
JERRY: I think Iâ€™ve played there.
GEORGE: Iâ€™ve had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
JERRY: Youâ€™re a little paranormal
ELAINE: Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
GEORGE: Really?
ELAINE: Uh uh, you should go some time.
GEORGE: Iâ€™d love to go. Make an appointment.
JERRY: Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?
GEORGE: I just got fired.
JERRY: Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
ELAINE: I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
JERRY: I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
ELAINE: Really?
JERRY: Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.
[They exit]
[Jerryâ€™s apartment late at night there is knocking at the door]
JERRY: Who is it? Who is it?
GINA: Itâ€™s Gina.
JERRY: Who?
GINA: Martineâ€™s girl friend.
JERRY: Martine?
GINA: You next door neighbour.
JERRY: Oh, Martin!
[Jerry opens door]
GEORGE: Itâ€™s Martine. I think heâ€™s dying. He tried to kill 
        himself with pills.
JERRY: What?
GINA: Come on.
JERRY: In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
GINA: We donâ€™t have enough time.
JERRY: Itâ€™ll take two seconds.
GINA: There is no time.
JERRY: We donâ€™t have two seconds?
GINA: All right. Go ahead.
JERRY: Nah, forget it.
GINA: No, go ahead.
JERRY: Nah. Iâ€™ll just wear the pajamas.
GINA: Will you just get it.
JERRY: Are you sure?
GINA: Forget it. Come on.
JERRY: Nah, Iâ€™ll go get the robe.
[Metropolitan Hospital Center]
JERRY: Thatâ€™s not too bad. Itâ€™s not like a Sunny von Bulow 
        comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
GINA: You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did 
        not want to see him anymore.
JERRY: Really? Itâ€™s over?
GINA: I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a 
        manâ€™s hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. 
        And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.
JERRY: Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
GINA: He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like 
        Drakeâ€™s Coffee Cake.
JERRY: He said that?
GINA: He was screaming about it all night. How itâ€™s too sweet and 
        it falls apart when you eat it.
JERRY: Iâ€™m sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
GINA: I wasnâ€™t.
JERRY: You werenâ€™t?
GINA: No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about 
        me?
JERRY: Of course.
GINA: Tell me everything.
JERRY: Are you sure he canâ€™t hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
GINA: I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could 
        pull the plug out from him.
JERRY: I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries 
        today, you never know how theyâ€™re going to look at a thing like this.
GINA: I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.
JERRY: No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
GINA: Are you afraid of him?
JERRY: No.
GINA: Then kiss me.
JERRY: Here?
GINA: Yes, right here.
JERRY: Is this the proper venue?
GINA: You donâ€™t want to?
JERRY: No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, 
        I pine to.
GINA: Then kiss me right in front of him.
JERRY: I canâ€™t. What if he wakes up?
GINA: A man is lying here unconscious and youâ€™re afraid of him? 
        What kind of a man are you?
JERRY: A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and 
        out comas, maybe. But when a guyâ€™s got a coma going like this â€¦ 
        you donâ€™t want to mess with it.
[Jerryâ€™s apartment]
KRAMER: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
KRAMER: Did you hear about Martin?
JERRY: Yeah, I heard.
KRAMER: I canâ€™t believe heâ€™s in a coma.
KRAMER: Heâ€™s got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. 
        He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
JERRY: Who told you about Martin?
KRAMER: Newman! Heâ€™s good friends with him.
Jx; Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.
KRAMER: Heâ€™s got all of my attachments, you know.
JERRY: Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for 
        a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
KRAMER: What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
JERRY: You know I donâ€™t get that whole suicide machine. Thereâ€™s 
        no tall buildings where these people live? They canâ€™t wrap their 
        lips around a revolver like a normal person?
KRAMER: So whatâ€™s going on between you and Gina?
JERRY: Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
KRAMER: Uh, uh.
JERRY: So weâ€™re in the room and sheâ€™s trying to get me to kiss 
        her right in front of him.
KRAMER: Uh, uh, you see thatâ€™s the great thing about Mediterranean 
        women. All right, so what did you do?
JERRY: Nothing.
KRAMER: Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma 
        and you donâ€™t have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
JERRY: I didnâ€™t know what the coma etiquette was.
KRAMER: There is no coma etiquette. You see thatâ€™s the beauty of 
        the coma, man. It doesnâ€™t matter what you do around it.
JERRY: So youâ€™re saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, itâ€™s 
        all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
KRAMER: Iâ€™d give him 24 hours to get out of it. They canâ€™t 
        get out of it in 24 hours, itâ€™s a land rush.
JERRY: So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, heâ€™s thrilled, 
        he got out of the coma. He goes home, thereâ€™s nothing left?
KRAMER: NOTHING LEFT! Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m trying to get that vacuum 
        cleaner. Because somebodyâ€™s going to grab it.
[The psychicâ€™s apartment]
RULA: Martinâ€™s spirit came to you as a warning.
ELAINE: Why would he come to George?
RULA: Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET 
        YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.
GEORGE: I knew it. I always felt different.
RULA: You are. Some coffee cake?
GEORGE: Drakes?
RULA: Yes.
GEORGE: Did you buy this for me?
RULA: No, why?
GEORGE: Ha, because I love Drakeâ€™s Coffee Cake.
RULA: Maybe I did.
ELAINE: Take it away.
GEORGE: She hasnâ€™t eaten in two days.
RULA: Whoâ€™s Pauline?
GEORGE: Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated 
        a woman named Pauline.
RULA: Do you think about her?
GEORGE: When I hear her name mentioned.
RULA: Cut these with your left hand.
GEORGE: There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
RULA: I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.
GEORGE: Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she 
        ever speak to me again?
RULA: Not in this life.
ELAINE: Should you be smoking?
RULA: Does it bother you?
ELAINE: Youâ€™re pregnant.
GEORGE: Elaine.
RULA: I smoked when I had Faisy.
RULA: Ah oh.
GEORGE: Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
RULA: I donâ€™t know about this trip George.
GEORGE: You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to 
        happen to me? What?
ELAINE: Itâ€™s really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
GEORGE: Elaine, sheâ€™s a psychic. She knows how the kidâ€™s going 
        to be.
GEORGE: Should I not go on this trip?
RULA: George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really 
        hear me.
ELAINE: Now listen. I just donâ€™t know how a person, with everything 
        we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
GEORGE: Elaine, what are you doing?
ELAINE: Itâ€™s disgusting.
RULA: I DONâ€™T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.
ELAINE: Oh fine, I donâ€™t like to be around people who are just so 
        irresponsible.
RULA: Get the hell out.
[Elaine leaving]
GEORGE: A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
RULA: Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.
GEORGE: If you donâ€™t say anything I will assume itâ€™s a plane 
        crash.
RULA: Get out.
GEORGE: Not a plane crash. [leaving] Is it a plane crash?
[Jerryâ€™s apartment]
GINA: I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.
JERRY: You can say what you want about me but Iâ€™ll be damned if 
        Iâ€™m going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
GINA: It is too small for someone with such a big mouth [kisses Kerry]. 
        Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a 
        mouse?
JERRY: No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
GINA: Who are these Stooges you speak of?
JERRY: Theyâ€™re a comedy team.
GINA: Tell me about them. Everything.
JERRY: Well, theyâ€™re three kind of funny looking guys and they hit 
        each other a lot.
GINA: You will show me The Stooges?
JERRY: I will show you The Stooges.
GINA: When?
JERRY: Well, I donâ€™t really know where The Stooges are right now 
        but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
GINA: Come, you walk me to a cab.
JERRY: Well, uh, I uh, I donâ€™t want you to get upset or anything 
        but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe itâ€™s not such a good idea 
        for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had 
        a lot of friends here.
GINA: Youâ€™re still afraid. You are not a man.
JERRY: Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my 
        closet?
GINA: Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
JERRY: Yeah, all right. All right.
[Jerry and Gina meet Kramer and leaving his apartment with Newman]
KRAMER: You should just eat fruit.
NEWMAN: I canâ€™t eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
KRAMER: ???
NEWMAN: Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
JERRY: Hello Newman.
[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway]
JERRY: Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind 
        of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
GEORGE: People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnâ€™t hurt me.
ELAINE: [jumps with fear to Jerry] Did you see that wall move?
JERRY: Boy, itâ€™s a good thing we came.
GEORGE: Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe thereâ€™s 
        native unrest.
ELAINE: Hi, I havenâ€™t eaten in three days. I was wondering how much 
        longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
Nurse: Weâ€™ll call you.
JERRY: George, I want you to promise me something. If Iâ€™m ever in 
        a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and 
        put it in storage.
GEORGE: How come?
JERRY: Looters.
ELAINE: How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
JERRY: Sheâ€™s really hungry.
[Kramer enters]
KRAMER: Hey.
ELAINE: Kramer
KRAMER: Well, Newmanâ€™s upstairs visiting Martin.
GEORGE: Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
KRAMER: Youâ€™re not going?
GEORGE: No.
KRAMER: Why not?
GEORGE: The psychic said something terrible will happen.
KRAMER: I dig.
[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Martinâ€™s room]
KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, 
        sheâ€™s going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, sheâ€™s going 
        to kill me.
W: He canâ€™t hear you, you idiot. Why donâ€™t you just buy another 
        one.
KRAMER: Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this 
        one?
W: I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
KRAMER: I donâ€™t want a carpet sweeper. They donâ€™t do anything.
W: It gets my rug clean.
KRAMER: The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American 
        public since One Hour Martinizing.
W: Well, you should take a look at my rug then.
KRAMER: I wouldnâ€™t set foot in your house.
[Jerry enters]
JERRY: Hello.
NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.
JERRY: Howâ€™s he doing?
KRAMER: He looks happy to me.
NEWMAN: I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
JERRY: Why wouldnâ€™t he?
NEWMAN: No reason.
JERRY: Heâ€™ll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
NEWMAN: Iâ€™ll bring him up to date.
JERRY: How up to date?
NEWMAN: Oh, all the way up.
JERRY: And nothing could change your mind?
NEWMAN: Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something 
        you earn.
KRAMER: Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands 
        for this weekend. Heâ€™s not going.
NEWMAN: I donâ€™t care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that 
        a,..
JERRY: Drakeâ€™s Coffee Cake
NEWMAN: Wow, where did you get that?
JERRY: From my house. I got a whole box of them.
NEWMAN: Boy, thatâ€™s the full size.
JERRY: Thatâ€™s your big boy.
NEWMAN: Can I have a bite?
JERRY: I donâ€™t give out bites. I got another one. But Iâ€™m saving 
        it for later.
NEWMAN: Just one bite?
JERRY: I donâ€™t think so. You know they, theyâ€™re so fragile.
NEWMAN: All right! All right. I wonâ€™t say anything.
JERRY: You swear?
NEWMAN: I swear.
JERRY: On your motherâ€™s life?
NEWMAN: On my motherâ€™s life.
KRAMER: oh oh oh oh oh
NEWMAN: Oooh,
[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway]
ELAINE: And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, 
        but juicy tender breasts of duck.
[George sees the Psychicâ€™s girl, Faisy and follows her into the 
        Psychicâ€™s room]]
GEORGE: â€¦sweetheart, no come here, â€¦ sweetheart
RULA: pew, pew, pew, pew (breathing)
GEORGE: how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is 
        phenomenal.
RULA: The nurse said she would be right back. Theyâ€™re supposed to 
        take me into the delivery room.
GEORGE: Oh, thatâ€™s great. Thatâ€™s great. By the way I have to 
        apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I donâ€™t even 
        know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnâ€™t 
        get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
RULA: Oh, whereâ€™s the nurse
GEORGE: I donâ€™t know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why donâ€™t 
        you get a nurse for mommy? â€¦ Anyway I was just curious. Remember 
        the other day you were saying something about my trip.
RULA: Donâ€™t take that trip.
GEORGE: Yeah, why? Why?
RULA: <screams> EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit.
[Doctor enters]
Dx: All right, Rula, itâ€™s time to go.
GEORGE: Because? Because?
[Elaine enters Martins room]
ELAINE: Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this! â€¦ 
        Drakeâ€™s Coffee Cake? â€¦ Give me that.
NEWMAN: Jerry, you better stop her or Iâ€™ll tell.
JERRY: Elaine! No! No!
MARTIN: Ooooh, ahhhh,
[In hallway as they wheel Rula to give birth]
GEORGE: Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? 
        Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
[Martinâ€™s room â€“ Martin grabbing Jerry â€“ Elaine eating 
        the Drakeâ€™s Coffee Cake]
NEWMAN: He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.
KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner!
JERRY: Hey!
NEWMAN: It was disgusting.
[Jerryâ€™s apartment]
JERRY: What are you doing? Weâ€™re going out to dinner in ten minutes.
GEORGE: I never assisted in a birth before. Itâ€™s really quite disgusting.
JERRY: What did she name the kid?
GEORGE: You wouldnâ€™t believe it. Rasputin.
[Kramer enters]
KRAMER: Heey!
GEORGE: Hey.
JERRY: Hey.
GEORGE: when did you get back?
KRAMER: A couple of hours ago.
GEORGE: So how was it?
KRAMER: George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days 
        I ever spent in my life.
JERRY: osh.
KRAMER: They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right 
        in the hotel pool.
JERRY: Woah. [hitting George]
KRAMER: Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the 
        beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down 
        there.
JERRY: Wow! [hitting George]
KRAMER: I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
JERRY: Oh! [hitting George]
KRAMER: We played Backgammon in the nude.
JERRY: Oh! [hitting George]
KRAMER: Sheâ€™s a sweet kid.
JERRY: Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
KRAMER: Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a 
        jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thatâ€™s probably what Rula 
        was trying to warn you about.
GEORGE: Yeah, you gottaâ€™ watch for the jellyfish.
KRAMER: Yeah.
KRAMER: Whatâ€™s this?
JERRY: Oh, itâ€™s an invitation to a house warming from Martin and 
        Gina.
KRAMER: They moved in together?
JERRY: Yeah, itâ€™s some place down in the village.
KRAMER: Phew.
[buzzer]
JERRY: Yeah.
ELAINE: Itâ€™s Elaine.
JERRY: All right weâ€™re coming down.
KRAMER: Hey, where yaâ€™ going?
JERRY: Weâ€™re taking Elaine to dinner. Sheâ€™s got to start the 
        fast again. Um, you want to go?
KRAMER: Um, Iâ€™d like to but a bunch of us from the islands, weâ€™ll 
        be getting together.
GEORGE: Elle McPherson going to be there?
KRAMER: OH! I got to call her back.
